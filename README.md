# ConvolutionalNN
Convolutional Neural Network with 3 classes: BMW cars(basically cars but trained with BMW images), roses and motorbikes.

To test the code, run "convmodel_player.py" so it gets images from the webcam of your device.
To run the code, run "convmodelval.py" to train and check the nn.
